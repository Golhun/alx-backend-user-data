# 🔐 REST API Authentication Project

Welcome to the **REST API Authentication Project**! This project explores essential authentication mechanisms, focusing on **Basic Authentication** using **Base64 encoding** and the **Authorization** HTTP header. We’re implementing a Flask-based API to understand these core authentication concepts deeply.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is designed to teach the essentials of authentication within REST APIs. It includes:
- Understanding **Base64** encoding
- Implementing **Basic Authentication** in HTTP headers
- Utilizing **Flask** to set up and manage API routes
- Encoding and decoding strings for secure communication

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Define **authentication** and explain its importance 🔑
- Understand and implement **Base64 encoding**
- Encode and decode strings in Base64 within Python
- Set up **Basic Authentication** headers in HTTP requests
- Manage and secure endpoints in a Flask API

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.7 (interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- **Code Style**: Following `pycodestyle` standards (version 2.5)
- **Documentation**: Every module, class, and function should be documented with descriptive sentences
- **Executable Scripts**: Ensure all scripts are executable
- **README.md**: A comprehensive README file (you’re reading it!)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest-api-authentication.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rest-api-authentication
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💻 Usage

Run the Flask application to start the server:
```bash
./app.py
```
Use a REST client (e.g., **Postman**) or `curl` to test the authentication endpoints.

### Sample Request
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/your-endpoint -H "Authorization: Basic <your_encoded_credentials>"
```

## 📜 Documentation

- All modules, classes, and functions are thoroughly documented to describe their purpose and usage.
- Use the following command to view module documentation:
    ```python
    python3 -c 'print(__import__("module_name").__doc__)'
    ```
